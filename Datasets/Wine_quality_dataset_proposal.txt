Attached here are two datasets for two types of wine: red and white. The data primarily covers the chemical properties of both types,
including the amounts of sugar and alcohol they contain, and how these factors affect the quality of the wine.
 
I find this data very useful for my project because it will enable me to apply prediction models to forecast the quality of the wine.

I have also merged the two datasets into a single dataset called Wine_Quality_Dataset
and created a new column to indicate the type of wine, whether red or white.
This will allow me to apply classification models to distinguish between the two types.


This dataset does not have any missing values, but it does contain some duplicates, so it requires data cleaning.

 
The dataset consists of:

6,497 rows
13 columns
